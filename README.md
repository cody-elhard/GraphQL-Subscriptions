⚠️ Requires paid usage of "Ruby GraphQL Pro"

# GraphQL-Subscriptions

- A demo project using `create-react-app` and `rails new` to demonstrate the use of GraphQL subscriptions

## Getting started

cd /backend && bundle && rails start
cd /frontend && yarn && yarn start

## Helpful
- rails graphql:schema:dump will generate the graphql file from ruby graphql
- You will want to start a redis server
